# SSTable-Importer
In this project, I have implemented a utility to generate SSTables from a existing Cassandra table or a .csv file. The application can be used to bulk upload the data into Cassandra tables in one go from a .csv or existing cassandra tables.  


The problem this project aims to solve:
The major bottleneck in importing data or migrating data to databases is the time to dump the data (timeout issues, writing long running jobs which gets killed due to out of memory issues etc). This utility directly generates the SSTables which can be easily imported into Cassandra tables (around 400k-500k records). The data can be dumped into Cassanra using this SSTables generation (my code) and import logic (use SSTable importer to import the SSTables generated by my code).

Run this code to generate the SSTables from a .csv or a existing Cassandra Table.

Java Classes:
CassandraBatchItemReader - reads a Cassandra Table from where the data has to be migrated from.
SSTableWriter - Generates the SSTables for the data read above from the Cassandra tables.

Once the SSTables are generated using this code, use the SSTable importer of Cassandra to directly bulk import the data in Cassandra.
